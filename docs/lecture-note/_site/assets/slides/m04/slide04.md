# In-class Experiment 🔬

1. 📇 Receive a card with a unique letter
2. 🤝 Meet & greet: exchange cards with at least one friend (5 mins)
3. 🧮 Count received cards, write number, return cards (2 mins)
4. 📈 Calculate average 'friend count' of your friends (

# Friendship Paradox

## Your friends have more friends than you, on average

---
# Friendship Paradox Explained 🤔

- 📊 It's about measurement, not friendship formation!
- Average # of friends of you = Average over nodes
- Average # of friends of your friends = Average over edges

# Let's put on our mathematician hat 🎓

- Let $P_0(k)$ be the probability of a node having degree $k$
- Let $P_1(k)$ be the probability of a friend having degree $k$
- How does $P_1(k)$ look like?
- Hint:
  - Nodes with $k$ edges appear $k$ times more likely as a friend of someone than a person with $1$ edge. Thus, $P_1(k) \propto \; ????$. To get the actual distribution, you will need $\langle k \rangle = \sum_{k} k P_0(k)$
- Compute the average degree of friends over edges

---

# Degree distribution of friends

- $P_1(k) = \frac{k}{\langle k \rangle} P_0(k)$

- Average degree of friends
  - $\langle k_f \rangle = \sum_{k} k P_1(k) = \sum_{k} \frac{k^2}{\langle k \rangle} P_0(k) = \frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle}$

# How is it useful?

## The Challenge
- 🦠 Control virus spread through strategic vaccination
- 🎯 Utilize the friendship paradox for effective strategies

## The Game
- 🎮 Play the [Vaccination Game](BASE_URL/vis/vaccination-game.html)
- 💉 Vaccinate strategically to halt virus spread
- 🧠 Think about how the friendship paradox influences your strategy

# Degree is crucial for network science!

- Network Robustness
- Epidemic Spreading and Controlling
- Community Detection
- ...

Understanding degree distribution is crucial for network analysis. But how do we plot it? 🤔 (it's not as easy as it seems!)

# Data Visualization: CDF and CCDF 📉

## Definitions
- CDF: $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$
- CCDF: $\bar{F}(x) = P(X > x) = 1 - F(x)$

# Visualization of Degree Distribution: Hands-on 🧠

1. Create Barabási-Albert network
3. Compute degree of each node
4. Calculate degree distribution

## Visualization
- Use log-log plots
- CCDF for clearer tail visualization

---

# CCDF in Log-Log Plot 📉

## Interpretation
- Slope indicates heterogeneity
- Steep slope: more homogeneous
- Flat slope: more heterogeneous

## Power-Law Relation
$\log [\text{CCDF}(d)] = (-\gamma + 1) \cdot \log d + \text{const.}$
