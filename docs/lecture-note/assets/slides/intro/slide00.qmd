## Course Overview

- **Instructor:** Sadamori Kojaku (Âπ∏Ëã•ÂÆåÂ£Æ)
- **Email:** skojaku@binghamton.edu
- **Office Hours:** Friday 10:00-14:00
- **Course Website:** [https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci)


## Let's start with a story... ü¶†

2009: H1N1 pandemic spreads globally

Do you remember which countries were infected first and second? Why do you think these countries were affected first and second?

Think about it for 30 seconds.

::: {.incremental}

- **Your predictions:**

  - Geographic distance matters?
  - Nearby countries first?
  - Then spreading outward in circles?

- *Let's hear some thoughts...*

:::

## Answer


- First: United States

- Second: **Spain**


## Here's what actually happened...

**Question:** What do you notice? Does this match your prediction?

---

**Key insight:** Network structure (air travel) determined spread, not geography!

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/66d5a7ec-a683-4135-af2f-149c91007e48/assets/graphic/342_1337_f2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">


## Spot the Networks! üëÄ

**Look around you right now...**

What networks do you interact with daily?

*Take 1 minute - list as many networks as you can*

## Let's Share! üó£Ô∏è

**What did you come up with?**

*I'll collect a few examples from the class...*

## Here Are Some You Might Have Missed:

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

How do ideas spread through social networks?

Same as diseases? Different?

**Transportation networks shape our daily choices!**

## Wait - Isn't This Just Graph Theory? ü§î


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

These are typical topological patterns studied in Graph Theory.

What do you notice about this pattern?

What's different here?

Why does this "messiness" matter?

*Question - what makes real networks "messy"?*

## Philosophers on the Nature of Reality

::: {.incremental}
- Thales of Miletus (c. 624‚Äì546 BCE): *Everything is water.*
- Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570‚Äì495 BCE): *All is number.*
- Democritus of Abdera (c. 460‚Äì370 BCE): *Everything is made of atoms.*
- Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650): *Divide each problem into as many parts as possible.*

- **Key insight:** Seek the fundamental building blocks‚Äîwhether substance, number, atom, or principle‚Äîby [breaking down complex systems into their simplest elements]{.red-text}.
:::



## The Reductionist Approach üß©

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

*Break it down ‚Üí Understand parts ‚Üí Reassemble*

*This works well. Does it?*

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Thought Experiment ü§î

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}


::: {.incremental}

- Imagine you're an Alien scientist (like von Neumann!) studying humans...

- You understand every single neuron in the human brain perfectly.

- Can we say we understand human consciousness? Why?

:::

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif){width=50% fig-align="center"}

:::

::::

---

::: {.incremental}
- You can know every neuron *but not predict consciousness*
- You can study every person *but not understand social movements*
- ...because [parts do not operate in isolation but work together in tandem]{.red-text}
- **The relationship of parts matters!**
:::


## Today's highlight

Who is among the first to study the relationship of parts?

**Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783)**

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg/500px-Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg){width=50% fig-align="center"}

**LLM Dojo**


- You'll create challenging questions for LLMs.

- You'll win if you can create one that stumps LLMs.

- Every module has a LLM Dojo exercise

- Collected & Graded on GitHub

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

You'll create a quiz & answer for LLMs.

```toml
[[questions]]
question = """
    When is the global clustering not a
    good representation of the network?
    """
answer = """
    When the network is degree
    heterogeneous. This is because
    a single hub can create
    substantially many triangles
    in the network, not
    representing the number of
    triangles typical nodes
    in the network form.
    """
```
