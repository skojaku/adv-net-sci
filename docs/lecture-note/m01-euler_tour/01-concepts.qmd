## The Königsberg Bridge Problem

### A Sunday Stroll That Changed Mathematics

Back in the 18th century, there was a city called *Königsberg* situated on the Pregel River in what was then Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The city was built around two large islands, beautifully connected to each other and the mainland by seven elegant bridges.

::: {.column-margin}
Königsberg was a major intellectual center of the Enlightenment. [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) spent his entire life there, never traveling more than 10 miles from the city. The university attracted scholars from across Europe.
:::

During their leisurely Sunday walks, the citizens of Königsberg found themselves pondering an intriguing puzzle:


::: {.callout-note title="The Königsberg Bridge Problem"}
Is it possible to take a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point?

This seemingly innocent recreational question would become one of the most important problems in the history of mathematics. What made it revolutionary wasn't the answer, but ***how*** the answer was found.

## Try It Yourself First!

Before we reveal Euler's brilliant solution, **take some time to think about this problem yourself**. This is exactly how mathematical discovery works—by wrestling with puzzles and developing your own insights.

::: {.callout-tip title="Work Through It Step by Step"}
**Highly recommended**: Download and work through this excellent [pen-and-paper worksheet](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf) created by Esteban Moro [@esteban-moro-worksheet]. It guides you through Euler's reasoning step by step, letting you discover the solution yourself.

**Questions to consider while working:**

- Can you trace a path that crosses each bridge exactly once?
- What patterns do you notice when you try different routes?
- What properties of the landmasses seem important?
- How might you prove that something is impossible, rather than just failing to find it?
:::

The beauty of mathematics lies not just in the answers, but in the process of discovery.

## ⚠️ Pause Here First!

**Before reading Euler's solution below**, we strongly encourage you to:

1. **Work through the [pen-and-paper worksheet](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf)** by Esteban Moro
2. **Try the puzzle yourself** - can you find a path that crosses each bridge exactly once?
3. **Think about what makes this problem difficult** - what constraints do you notice?

The learning experience is much richer when you discover the insights yourself first!

### 🔍 Euler's Revolutionary Abstraction

[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) approached this puzzle in 1736 with a stroke of genius that would define mathematical thinking for centuries. Instead of getting bogged down in the physical details—the width of the bridges, the size of the islands, the beauty of the architecture—he made a ***radical simplification***.

::: {.column-margin}
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, contributing to nearly every area of mathematics. He lost sight in his right eye in 1738 but continued his work, producing almost half of his total output after becoming completely blind in 1766.

:::

This was revolutionary thinking for its time. Before Euler, mathematics focused on quantities, measurements, and calculations. Euler showed that sometimes the *relationships* between objects matter more than the objects themselves.

Euler realized that for this problem, only one thing mattered: ***which landmasses connect to which other landmasses***. Everything else—the bridge lengths, island shapes, water depths—was irrelevant distraction.

He simplified the city into *a network of landmasses connected by bridges*:

Euler's graph of the bridges of Knigsberg. Taken from  [The Essential Guide to Graph Theory: From an 18th Century Riddle to AI Frameworks](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-essential-guide-to-graph-theory-from-an-18th-century-riddle-to-artificial-intelligence-c441cb9400de/)

:::

This abstraction—reducing a complex physical system to its essential connectivity—was the birth of ***graph theory***. Euler had invented a new mathematical language for describing relationships.

Once Euler had his abstract graph, he made another crucial insight. Instead of trying different walking routes (which would take forever), he focused on a fundamental property: ***how many bridges connect to each landmass?***

::: {.column-margin}
This shift from "trying all possibilities" to "analyzing constraints" is a hallmark of mathematical thinking. Instead of brute force, Euler used logical reasoning to prove impossibility.
:::

Euler considered the degree (number of connections) of each node and realized there were only two cases:
- a node has an **even number** of edges, or
- a node has an **odd number** of edges.

When a node has an even number $2k$ of edges, you can enter and leave the node exactly $k$ times by crossing different edges. Every time you enter through one bridge, you can leave through another. The bridges naturally pair up.

When a node has an odd number $2k+1$ of edges, you can enter and leave the node $k$ times, but one edge is left over. The only way to cross this last edge is if your journey ***starts or ends*** at this node.

::: {.column-margin}
Think of it like a dance where everyone needs a partner. In nodes with even degree, every bridge has a "partner" for entering and leaving. Odd-degree nodes always have one "wallflower" bridge that can only be used at the very beginning or end.
:::

Based on this elegant reasoning, Euler arrived at his famous theorem:

::: {.callout-note title="Euler's Path Theorem"}
A walk that crosses all edges exactly once exists **if and only if**:

1. **The graph is connected** (you can reach any node from any other node), **AND**
2. **Either:**
   - All nodes have even degree (forms an Euler circuit), **OR**
   - Exactly two nodes have odd degree (forms an Euler path)

:::

This wasn't just a solution—it was a **proof**. Euler had shown not just whether such a path exists, but exactly when it's possible.

### ⚖️ The Verdict: Königsberg's Impossible Dream

Applying Euler's theorem to the original Königsberg bridges reveals the truth: **every landmass has an odd number of bridges**. According to Euler's conditions, this makes the desired walk impossible.

::: {.column-margin}
In the original graph: North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), Small island (3 bridges). Four nodes with odd degree—exactly two more than Euler's theorem allows.
:::

The citizens of Königsberg had been attempting the impossible. Their Sunday stroll puzzle had no solution, and Euler had proven it with mathematical certainty.

The story takes a sobering turn during World War II. In 1944, Königsberg was heavily bombed by Allied forces, and later captured by the Soviet Union. Two of the seven historic bridges were destroyed in the bombardment.

![](../figs/seven-bridge-bombared.png){#fig-markdown-fig fig-alt="Two bridges were bombed by Soviet Union, which allows the Euler path to exist."}

: After WWII bombing, only five bridges remained—finally making an Euler path possible. {#fig-markdown-fig}

::: {.column-margin}
The city was renamed Kaliningrad and became part of Russia. Today, it remains a Russian exclave, separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. The few remaining bridges span a river now in a very different political landscape.
:::

With only five bridges remaining, the network finally satisfied Euler's conditions: exactly two nodes had odd degree. The mathematical puzzle that had stumped citizens for two centuries was "solved" by the tragic circumstances of war.

This ironic resolution reminds us that while mathematics reveals timeless truths about structure and possibility, the physical world—and human history—follows much more complex and unpredictable patterns.

### The Lasting Legacy

Euler's solution to the Königsberg bridge problem did far more than solve a recreational puzzle. It demonstrated that:

- **Abstract thinking** can solve concrete problems
- **Mathematical proof** is more powerful than trial and error
- **Network structure** determines what's possible in interconnected systems

These insights now underpin our understanding of everything from internet routing protocols to epidemic spreading models. Every time you use GPS navigation or analyze social network data, you're applying principles that trace back to Euler's Sunday stroll through Königsberg.

### Fun trivia:

**[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)** (1707-1783): Swiss mathematician and physicist, widely regarded as one of the most prolific mathematicians in history. Beyond solving the Königsberg bridge problem, he made fundamental contributions to calculus, topology, number theory, and physics. Despite losing sight in one eye and later becoming completely blind, he continued his mathematical work and produced nearly half of his total output after losing his sight.

**[Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)** (1724-1804): German philosopher and one of the central thinkers of the Enlightenment. Born and died in Königsberg, never traveling more than 10 miles from the city. His systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him one of the most influential figures in modern Western philosophy. His regular daily walks were so punctual that neighbors reportedly set their clocks by his daily walks.


## Walk, Path, and Trail

We used the term `walk` and `path` in the previous section. But what are they? Let's define them formally in the following.

A **walk** is the most general type of movement through a network. Imagine you're exploring a city with no restrictions:

- You can visit any vertex (intersection) multiple times
- You can traverse any edge (street) multiple times
- You simply move from one connected vertex to another

Formally, a walk is a sequence of nodes where each consecutive node pair is connected by an edge. No teleportation is allowed in a walk on a network.

A **trail** is a walk without traversing the same edge twice. You can still visit the same node multiple times though via different edges.

::: {.callout-note title="Trail"}

If edges are directed and two nodes are bidirectionally connected, then an edge from one node to the other is a different edge from the other node to the first node.

:::

::: {.column-margin}

:::

A **path** is a more restrictive type of walk without revisiting the same node.

::: {.column-margin}
- **Walk**: You can fly from New York to London, then back to New York, then to Paris, possibly using the same flight routes multiple times.
- **Trail**: You plan a trip where you never take the same flight route twice, but you might visit the same city more than once (e.g., New York $\rightarrow$ London $\rightarrow$ Paris $\rightarrow$ New York $\rightarrow$ Rome).
- **Path**: You visit a sequence of cities where you never visit the same city twice (e.g., New York $\rightarrow$ London $\rightarrow$ Paris $\rightarrow$ Rome).

In airline route maps, a *trail* means you never repeat a specific flight segment, while a *path* means you never return to a city you've already visited.
:::

### Cycle and Circuit

**Cycle** and **Circuit** are two special types of walks that start and end at the same node—they form closed loops in the network.

A **circuit** is a closed trail, i.e., a trail that starts and ends at the same node. Think of it as making a round trip where you never use the same road twice, but you can pass through the same intersections multiple times.

A **cycle** is a closed path, i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same node with no repeated nodes (except for the starting/ending node). It's the most restrictive type of closed walk.

::: {.column-margin}

The definition of cycle is a bit tricky 🤔. It is a path that does not allow revisiting the same node, but a cycle must be a roud-trip that starts and ends at the same node. Strictly speaking, a cycle is not a path since it has the same starting and ending node. You can think of a cycle as a special version of a path where no intermediate node is repeated.

:::


### Euler's Special Cases

Now we can precisely define what Euler was looking for in Königsberg:

- **Euler Trail**: A trail that includes every edge in the graph exactly once
- **Euler Circuit/Cycle**: An Euler trail that starts and ends at the same vertex

The Königsberg citizens were seeking an **Euler circuit**---a closed trail that would cross every bridge exactly once and return them home.


## Checking for Trails, Walks, and Paths

Now that we understand the theoretical definitions, how do we actually determine if a sequence of nodes represents a valid walk, trail, path, or cycle in practice? Let's develop systematic approaches to verify each type.

### Verifying a Walk

A **walk** is the most permissive—we simply need to check that each consecutive pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

**Algorithm**:
1. For each consecutive pair of nodes $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ in the sequence
2. Check if there exists an edge between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$
3. If any pair is not connected, it's not a valid walk

**Example**: In a friendship network, sequence [Alice, Bob, Charlie, Bob, David] is a valid walk if:
- Alice is friends with Bob ✓
- Bob is friends with Charlie ✓  
- Charlie is friends with Bob ✓
- Bob is friends with David ✓

### Verifying a Trail

A **trail** requires all edges to be distinct, but nodes can repeat.

**Algorithm**:
1. First verify it's a valid walk (all consecutive pairs connected)
2. Create a list of all edges used in the sequence
3. Check for duplicate edges—if any edge appears twice, it's not a trail

**Key consideration**: In directed graphs, edge $(A,B)$ is different from edge $(B,A)$.

**Example**: Sequence [A, B, C, B, D] uses edges: $(A,B)$, $(B,C)$, $(C,B)$, $(B,D)$
- If undirected: $(B,C)$ and $(C,B)$ are the same edge → Not a trail
- If directed: All edges are distinct → Valid trail

### Verifying a Path

A **path** requires all nodes (except possibly start/end for cycles) to be distinct.

**Algorithm**:
1. First verify it's a valid walk
2. Check if any intermediate node appears more than once
3. For cycles: allow start node = end node, but all other nodes must be unique

**Example**: Sequence [A, B, C, D] is a valid path if A, B, C, D are all different nodes and properly connected.

### Practical Verification Steps

Here's a systematic approach to classify any node sequence:

```
Given sequence: [v₀, v₁, v₂, ..., vₖ]

1. CONNECTIVITY CHECK
   For i = 0 to k-1:
     If no edge exists between vᵢ and vᵢ₊₁:
       → Not a valid walk
   
2. NODE UNIQUENESS CHECK  
   If all nodes are unique:
     → Valid path
   If start = end AND all intermediate nodes unique:
     → Valid cycle
     
3. EDGE UNIQUENESS CHECK
   If all edges are unique but some nodes repeat:
     → Valid trail (but not path)
   If start = end AND all edges unique:
     → Valid circuit (but not cycle)
     
4. OTHERWISE
   → Valid walk only
```

### Common Pitfalls

::: {.callout-warning title="Watch Out For These Mistakes"}
**Directed vs Undirected**: In directed graphs, $(A,B) \neq (B,A)$. Always consider edge direction when checking for duplicates.

**Self-loops**: An edge from a node to itself $(A,A)$ can be tricky. It's both the start and end of an edge, affecting degree calculations.

**Multiple edges**: Some graphs allow multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. Each is considered distinct for trail verification.

**Empty paths**: A sequence with just one node is technically a valid path of length 0.
:::

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Is the sequence connected? → No: Not a walk
                         → Yes: Continue

Are all nodes unique? → Yes: Path (or cycle if closed)
                    → No: Continue  

Are all edges unique? → Yes: Trail (or circuit if closed)
                    → No: Walk only
```

### Quiz

1. Is a path always a trail?
2. What is the condition for a graph to have an Euler circuit?
3. Is the condition for Euler circuit different from the condition for Euler trail?
4. Given sequence [A, B, C, B, D] in an undirected graph, is this a valid trail? Why or why not?
5. In a directed graph, can sequence [X, Y, X] be both a valid trail and invalid trail depending on the edges present?
