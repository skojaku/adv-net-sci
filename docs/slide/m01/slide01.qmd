## Course Overview

- **Instructor:** Sadamori Kojaku (幸若完壮)
- **Email:** skojaku@binghamton.edu
- **Office Hours:** Monday 10:00-14:00
- **Course Website:** [https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci)


## Let's start with a story... 🦠

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}

2009: H1N1 pandemic spreads globally

Do you remember which countries were infected first and second?

:::

Think about it... discuss with your neighbor for 30 seconds

::: {.incremental}

- **Your predictions:**

  - Geographic distance matters?
  - Nearby countries first?
  - Then spreading outward in circles?

- *Let's hear some thoughts...*

:::

## Answer

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}

- First: United States

- Second: **Spain**

:::

## Here's what actually happened...

**Question:** What do you notice? Does this match your prediction?

---

**Key insight:** Network structure (air travel) determined spread, not geography!

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/66d5a7ec-a683-4135-af2f-149c91007e48/assets/graphic/342_1337_f2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">


## Quick Exercise: Spot the Networks! 👀

::: {.callout-note title = "Challenge:"}
**Look around you right now...**

What networks do you interact with daily?

*Take 1 minute - list as many networks as you can*

    When is the global clustering not a
    good representation of the network?
    """
answer = """
    When the network is degree
    heterogeneous. This is because
    a single hub can create
    substantially many triangles
    in the network, not
    representing the number of
    triangles typical nodes

### Euler's Revolutionary Approach 🧠

**What if we ignore all the physical details? 🙂 **

What do you see in this transformation?
*What's the key insight?*


![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/15n0gkvpktkGYtAase5oYuw-1.png){width=800 fig-align="center"}

## The Breakthrough Insight ✨

**Euler realized:** Only connections matter, not physical details!

- Landmasses → **dots** (nodes)
- Bridges → **lines** (edges)

**Abstraction is the a cornerstone of Network Science**

*This was the birth of graph theory and network science!*

## Euler's Reasoning 🧮

**If you walk through a node, what happens?**

You enter on one edge, leave on another...

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.incremental}
- **Even number of edges**: Enter/leave perfectly ✅
- **Odd number**: One edge "left over" ❌
- **Question:** Where can those "leftover" edges be?
- *Only at start/end points!*

Euler's theorem says:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}



- **0 odd nodes** → Euler circuit possible ✅
- **2 odd nodes** → Euler path possible ✅
- **More than 2** → ?

**What does this mean for Königsberg?**

*What's your verdict?*

## Euler's Path Theorem 🏆

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
An Euler path/circuit exists if and only if:

1. Graph is connected, AND

2. Either:
   - All nodes have even degree
   - Exactly two nodes have odd degree

Königsberg verdict: 4 odd-degree nodes → **IMPOSSIBLE!**
:::

## Aftermath


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

The story takes a sobering turn during World War II. In 1944, Königsberg was heavily bombed by Allied forces, and later captured by the Soviet Union. Two of the seven historic bridges were destroyed in the bombardment.

## Network Terminology 📚

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

**Context:** You just solved Königsberg! But wait... what exactly were the townspeople asking for?

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**Imagine you're giving directions to a lost tourist:**

"I want to visit every bridge exactly once and return home"

**Is this the same as visiting every location exactly once?**
:::

*Turn to your neighbor - discuss the difference for 30 seconds*

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](../lecture-note/m01-euler_tour/tikz-tex/c39860e7fa7562ba1d021b22b78e66cba5a9f51d/c39860e7fa7562ba1d021b22b78e66cba5a9f51d.svg){width=100% fig-align="center"}

## Let's Build Understanding Step by Step 🏗️

::: {.callout-note title = "Interactive Exercise:"}
**I'll give you scenarios - you tell me the terminology!**

*Raise your hands for each one...*
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **Scenario A**: Walk from your dorm → cafeteria → library → dorm → cafeteria
- **Scenario B**: Walk from your dorm → cafeteria → library → gym (no returns)
- **Scenario C**: Use every hallway exactly once, end up back at start
- **Scenario D**: Visit every room exactly once, return to start
:::

## Discussion: What Did You Notice? 🤔

**Let's hear your classifications!**

*What patterns emerged from our scenarios?*

## The Mathematical Definitions 📖

::: {.incremental}
- **Walk**: Any sequence of connected nodes *(can repeat anything)*
  - *Like your daily routine - cafeteria multiple times!*
- **Trail**: Walk without repeating **edges** *(Euler trail)*
  - *Use every hallway once - this is key for Königsberg!*
- **Path**: Walk without repeating **nodes** 
  - *Visit every room once - no backtracking*
- **Circuit**: Closed trail *(starts/ends at same node)*
- **Cycle**: Closed path
:::

## Reflection: Back to Königsberg 🌉

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
**Königsberg sought an Euler circuit!**

A closed trail that uses every **bridge** (edge) exactly once.

*Not every location - every bridge!*
:::

::: {.callout-note title = "Think About It:"}
**Why does this distinction matter for real-world problems?**

*Give me an example where edge-traversal vs. node-visiting makes a difference...*

## 💻 Coding Time: Networks in Code! 🌐

::: {.callout-note title = "Next Steps:"}
[Let's represent networks with Python!](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci/m01-euler_tour/how-to-code-network.html) 🐍

We'll learn how computers store and analyze networks
:::

## Key Takeaways 🎯

::: {.incremental}
- **Mathematical abstraction**: Focus on structure, not physical details
- **Euler's theorem**: Degree constraints determine network traversability
- **Network terminology**: Walks, trails, paths, circuits, and cycles
- **Historical impact**: From recreational puzzle to foundation of network science
- **Modern relevance**: GPS navigation, internet routing, social networks
