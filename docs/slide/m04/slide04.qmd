# Friendship Paradox

**Your friends have more friends than you, on average**

## Friendship Paradox Explained 🤔

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- 📊 It's about measurement, not friendship formation!
- Average # of friends of you = Average over nodes
- Average # of friends of your friends = Average over edges

Let's approach this mathematically.

::: {.incremental}
- Let $P_0(k)$ be the probability of a node having degree $k$
- Let $P_1(k)$ be the probability of a friend having degree $k$
- How does $P_1(k)$ look like in terms of $P_0(k)$ and $k$?
- Hint:
  - Nodes with $k$ edges appear $k$ times more likely as a friend of someone than a person with $1$ edge. Thus, $P_1(k) \propto \; ????$. To get the actual distribution, you will need $\langle k \rangle = \sum_{k} k P_0(k)$
- Compute the average degree of friends over edges
:::

## Degree distribution of friends

- $P_1(k) = \frac{k}{\langle k \rangle} P_0(k)$

- Average degree of friends
  - $\langle k_f \rangle = \sum_{k} k P_1(k) = \sum_{k} \frac{k^2}{\langle k \rangle} P_0(k) = \frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle}$

## Degree is crucial for network science!

Understanding degree distribution is crucial for network analysis. But how do we plot it? 🤔 (it's not as easy as it seems!)

Definitions
**CDF**: $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$, **CCDF**: $\bar{F}(x) = P(X > x) = 1 - F(x)$
