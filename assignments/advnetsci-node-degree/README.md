# Workflow

1. Read the assignment instruction in [assignment/README.md](assignment/README.md)
2. Complete the assignment notebook (assignment/assignment.py). You have several options to do this:
  - (Recommended) Run `uv run marimo edit --sandbox assignment/assignment.py` in your terminal
  - Alternatively,
    - 1. Open the assignment in Cloud Marimo (Molab)
    - 2. Fork the notebook and complete the assignment. (You'll need to create an account on MoLab)
3. Complete [the quiz](assignment/quiz.toml)
4. Git add, commit, push the notebook. If you are not sure what they are, [here is a guide](https://graphite.dev/guides/git-add-commit-push)
5. The assignment will be auto-graded, and you can check out the results at [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)


# Computing environment

## Github Classroom

You can use Github Codespaces to complete the assignment. Note that this environment is not permanent and will be deleted after the course finishes. You can keep files in the codespace by git-pushing them to the repository.

## Local Machine

You can download the repo and work locally on your machine. Using "git clone" is the easiest way to do this.
